Front End: I believe Angular or REACT would be good choices to make a GUI for the system, with some forms to fill the data.
Back End:
 DATABASE: I don't think this system could be different on using either MYSQL or PostgreSQL both would work great. 
            The API is already using tables so it would be great to continue with a Relational DATABASE

Overall a lot more information is going to be needed for the different tables the system will need. 
Work on the API needs to be done to further expand this system as well on data structure
